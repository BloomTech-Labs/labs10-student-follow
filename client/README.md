## Project Overview

```
Learning is difficult. Teaching is hard. When learners have small triggers to remember content over a spread out period of time they retain more. Send customizable refreshrs at scheduled intervals after the initial lecture.
```

- `Refreshr` aims to help students retain information through the spaced-learning method with periodic, scheduled quizzes called "refreshrs"
- Students receive a "refreshr" with a short introductory review paragraph, a multiple choice question, and a short answer question all contained within a nice easy to follow format provided by the Typeform service
- The app schedules refreshrs to be sent out via email during specified times (2 days, 2 weeks, and 2 months) via the enterprise level mailing service called Sendgrid
- This project was designed for our Lambda School Labs 10 Capstone Project

### Key Features

```md
- Create a class and manage students in the class
- Create and edit Refreshrs to be sent out
- Assign a Refreshr to a class
- Schedule and automate delivery of refreshrs
- The Refreshrs automatically get delivered via email
- Auth0 is used to sign into the app
- Stripe is used to handle credit cards
```

# React Testing Library

- React Testing Library is a simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices
- The guiding principle: The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence [the tests] can give you
- This tool was designed to work alongside Jest and Mocha, not to replace them
- React Testing Library is less opinionated than Enzyme and makes the testing process more developer-friendly, this library can also replace Enzyme
- Write tests for React components that avoid including implementation details
- Maintain your tests so it won't break tests or slow down the team even with code refactoring when making changes to implementation but not functionality
```
