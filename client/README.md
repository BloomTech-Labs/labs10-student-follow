## Project Overview

```
"Learning is difficult. Teaching is hard. When learners have small triggers to remember content over a spread out period of time they retain more. Send customizable quizzes on scheduled intervals of 2 days, 2 weeks and 2 months after the initial lecture."
```

- `Refreshr` aims to help students retain information through the spaced-learning method and periodic, scheduled quizzes called "refreshrs". This project was designed for our Lambda School Labs Capstone Project.

### Key Features

```
- Create a class and manage students in the class
- Create and edit Refreshrs
- A Refreshr should have a 2 day, 2 week, and 2 month review
- A Refreshr review item should have text and a multiple choice question
- Assign a Refreshr to a class with a lecture time to automate the delivery of quizzes
- The Refreshr s should be automatically delivered via email
- A teacher should be able to see the participation rate in dashboard
```

## Testing

### React Testing Library

- React Testing Library is a simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices
- The guiding principle: The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence [the tests] can give you
- This tool was designed to work alongside Jest and Mocha, not to replace them
- React Testing Library is less opinionated than Enzyme and makes the testing process more developer-friendly
- Write tests for React components that avoid including implementation details
- Maintain your tests so it won't break tests or slow down the team even with code refactoring when making changes to implementation but not functionality
